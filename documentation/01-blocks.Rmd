# Model Specification

In order to simulate the time varying variables of a system of ordinary differential equations you need to provide a specific representation of your mathematical model in a text file (a file with extension `.txt`). Every text file representation of a model must contain the following blocks presented exactly as defined below. Notice that each block name is preceded with ten `*`s. It is possible to comment out a line of code using `%`.

```
********** MODEL NAME

********** MODEL NOTES

********** MODEL STATES

********** MODEL PARAMETERS

********** MODEL VARIABLES

********** MODEL REACTIONS

********** MODEL FUNCTIONS

********** MODEL EVENTS
```

The remainder of this section deals with what each block is used for.

## Model Name and Model Notes

`Model Name` and `Model Notes` are descriptive blocks that allow the user to specify a model name and any notes about the model. The name of the model will be presented when an `azrmod` object is printed to the console.

Below are the model name and model notes blocks for the simple harmonic oscillator example in the **AZRsim** package (`sho.txt`).

```
********** MODEL NAME

Harmonic Oscillator

********** MODEL NOTES

Harmonic Oscillator ODE example.

```

Here is what the associated `azrmod` object looks like after calling `create_model` on the text file.

```
sho <- create_model(system.file("examples/sho.txt", package="AZRsim"))
sho
AZRmodel
========
Name:                       Harmonic Oscillator
Number States:              2
Number Parameters:          1
Number Variables:           0
Number Reactions:           0
Number Functions:           0
```

## Model States

The `Model States` block is where the user describes the system of differential equations followed by the initial conditions for each variable. The left hand side of each differential equation *must* be declared as `d/dt(x)` where `x` is a variable name chosen by the user.

The initial conditions *must* be defined, and they *must* be defined after the system of differential equations is defined. If variable `x` in the preceding paragraph had an initial condition value of 3 then we can declare `x(0) = 3` after defining the system of differential equations.

## Model Parameters

The `Model Parameters` block is where the user defines the values of the parameters in the system of differential equations defined in `Model States`.

## Model Variables

The `Model Variables` block provides a way to reparametrize parts of the model. Variables for intermediate calculations should be defined under `Model Variables`.

```
********** MODEL STATES

d/dt(A) = -R
d/dt(B) = R
A(0) = 1
B(0) = 0

********** MODEL PARAMETERS

k1 = 0.5

********** MODEL VARIABLES

R = k1*A

```

## Model Reactions

The `Model Reactions` block provides a way to reparametrize parts of the model. Reaction rates should be defined under `Model Reactions`.

```
********** MODEL STATES

d/dt(A) = -R
d/dt(B) = R
A(0) = 1
B(0) = 0

********** MODEL PARAMETERS

k1 = 0.5

********** MODEL REACTIONS

R = k1*A

```

## Model Functions

The `Model Functions` block can be used to define reoccuring calculations.

## Model Events

The `Model Events` block can be used to define discrete state events.

There are essentially two parts to defining a discrete event in the model:

1. When does the event take place?
2. What is the event?

Below is an example of a event block.

```
********* MODEL EVENTS

event1 = eq(time, 1), y, y+40
event2 = eq(time, 2), y, y+40

```

The term `eq(time, 1)` pertains to (1). This says that the event occurs when the time step is strictly equal to 1. The term `y, y+40` pertains to (2). This is the event that is to take place. In this case the event involves variable `y` and we want to add 40 units of the drug this variable, `y+40`. (Note that events cannot take place at time 0.) In summary, the above block defines adding 40 to the value of `y` at time steps 1 and 2.

We can issue multiple events. The event defined below specifies resetting the value of `x` to 1 and `y` to 0 when `x` is equal to 0.1.

```
********* MODEL EVENTS

event = eq(x, 0.1), x, 1, y, 0

```

Below is a summary of the options that can be used to declare when an event takes place.

* `eq(a, 0)` implies variable a is strictly equal to 0.
* `lq(a, 0)` implies variable a is less than or equal to 0.
* `gq(a, 0)` implies variable a is greater than or equal to 0.
* `lt(a, 0)` implies variable a is strictly less than 0.
* `gt(a, 0)` implies variable a is strictly greater than 0.
