********** MODEL NAME

model_1cpt_MM

********** MODEL NOTES

One compartmental distribution model with linear and saturable
elinination and with inputs allowing to realize first order
absorptions into central compartment and direct administration
into central compartment.

********** MODEL STATES

d/dt(Ad) 	= -ka*Ad + Fabs1*INPUT1
d/dt(Ac) 	=  ka*Ad - CL/Vc*Ac - VMAX*Cc/(KM+Cc) + INPUT2

Ad(0) 	 	= 0
Ac(0)    	= 0

********** MODEL PARAMETERS

Fabs1    	= 1   	% Bioavailability
ka 			  = 0.2 	% Absorption rate parameter
CL 			  = 0.4 	% Clearance
Vc 			  = 12 	  % Central volume
VMAX 			= 5     % Maximum rate of elimination of nonlinear term
KM        = 0.1   % Value of concentration at which half the maximum nonlinear elimination is achieved

********** MODEL VARIABLES

% Calculation of concentration in central compartment
Cc 			  = Ac/Vc

% Defining an output (only needed when interfacing with NLME
% parameter estimation tools such as NONMEM and MONOLIX)
OUTPUT1  	= Cc
