********** MODEL NAME

model_1cpt_linear

********** MODEL NOTES

Linear one compartmental distribution model with inputs
allowing to realize first order absorptions into central
compartment and direct administration into central compartment.

********** MODEL STATES

d/dt(Ad) 	= -ka*Ad + Fabs1*INPUT1
d/dt(Ac) 	=  ka*Ad - CL/Vc*Ac + INPUT2

Ad(0) 	 	= 0
Ac(0)    	= 0

********** MODEL PARAMETERS

Fabs1    	= 1   	% Bioavailability
ka 			  = 0.2 	% Absorption rate parameter
CL 			  = 0.4 	% Clearance
Vc 			  = 12 	% Central volume

********** MODEL VARIABLES

% Calculation of concentration in central compartment
Cc 			  = Ac/Vc

% Defining an output (only needed when interfacing with NLME
% parameter estimation tools such as NONMEM and MONOLIX)
OUTPUT1  	= Cc
