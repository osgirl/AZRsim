********** MODEL NOTES

Two compartmental distribution model with linear and saturable
elinination and with inputs allowing to realize first order
absorptions into central compartment and direct administration
into central compartment.

********** MODEL STATES

d/dt(Ad) 	= -ka*Ad + Fabs1*INPUT1
d/dt(Ac) 	=  ka*Ad - CL/Vc*Ac - Q1/Vc + Q1/Vp1 - VMAX*Cc/(KM+Cc) + INPUT2
d/dt(Ap1) =                     Q1/Vc - Q1/Vp1

Ad(0) 	 	= 0
Ac(0)    	= 0
Ap1(0)   	= 0

********** MODEL PARAMETERS

Fabs1    	= 1   	% Bioavailability
ka 			  = 0.2 	% Absorption rate parameter
CL 			  = 0.2 	% Clearance
Vc 			  = 3 	  % Central volume
Q1        = 0.8   % Intercompartmental clearance
Vp1       = 3     % Peripheral volume
VMAX 			= 5     % Maximum rate of elimination of nonlinear term
KM        = 0.1   % Value of concentration at which half the maximum nonlinear elimination is achieved

********** MODEL VARIABLES

% Calculation of concentration in central compartment
Cc 			  = Ac/Vc

% Defining an output (only needed when interfacing with NLME
% parameter estimation tools such as NONMEM and MONOLIX)
OUTPUT1  	= Cc
