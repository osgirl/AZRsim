********** MODEL NOTES

Linear three compartmental distribution model with inputs
allowing to realize first order absorptions into central
compartment and direct administration into central compartment.

********** MODEL STATES

d/dt(Ad) 	= -ka*Ad + Fabs1*INPUT1
d/dt(Ac) 	=  ka*Ad - CL/Vc*Ac - Q1/Vc*Ac + Q1/Vp1*Ap1 - Q2/Vc*Ac + Q2/Vp2*Ap2 + INPUT2
d/dt(Ap1) =                     Q1/Vc*Ac - Q1/Vp1*Ap1
d/dt(Ap2) =                                             Q2/Vc*Ac - Q2/Vp2*Ap2

Ad(0) 	 	= 0
Ac(0)    	= 0
Ap1(0)   	= 0
Ap2(0)   	= 0

********** MODEL PARAMETERS

Fabs1    	= 1   	% Bioavailability
ka 			  = 0.2 	% Absorption rate parameter
CL 			  = 0.2 	% Clearance
Vc 			  = 3 	  % Central volume
Q1        = 0.8   % Intercompartmental clearance first peripheral compartment
Vp1       = 3     % Peripheral volume first peripheral compartment
Q2        = 0.8   % Intercompartmental clearance second peripheral compartment
Vp2       = 3     % Peripheral volume second peripheral compartment

********** MODEL VARIABLES

% Calculation of concentration in central compartment
Cc 			  = Ac/Vc

% Defining an output (only needed when interfacing with NLME
% parameter estimation tools such as NONMEM and MONOLIX)
OUTPUT1  	= Cc
